## How to run me!
We discovered that we can't push into the repository large files, our jar is over 400Mb so you need to build it yourself
using the command
```py
./gradlew build
```


- You can run using the command 
```py
./gradlew run
```

- You can also run this project via jar in the `/lib` directory using the command
